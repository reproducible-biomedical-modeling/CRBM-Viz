Building more predictive models will likely require the collaborative efforts of many investigators. This requires teams to be able to share and reuse model components and simulations. Despite extensive efforts to develop standards such as COMBINE/OMEX , SBML , and SED-ML , it remains difficult to reuse many models and simulations. One challenge to reusing models and simulations is the diverse array of incompatible modeling formats and simulation tools. This package provides three tools which address this challenge: BioSimulators is a registry of containerized simulation tools that provide consistent interfaces. BioSimulators makes it easier to find and run simulations. runBioSimulations is a simple web application for using the BioSimulators containers to run simulations. This tool makes it easy to run a broad range of simulations without having to install any software. BioSimulations is a platform for sharing and running modeling studies. BioSimulations provides a central place for investigators to exchange studies. BioSimulations uses the BioSimulators simulation tools, and builds on the functionality of runBioSimulations. This package provides the code for the BioSimulations, runBioSimulations, and BioSimulations websites, as well as the code for the backend services for all three applications. The package is implemented in TypeScript using Angular, NestJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Getting started Users Please use the hosted versions of BioSimulations, runBioSimulations, and BioSimulators at https://biosimulations.org, https://run.biosimulations.org, and https://biosimulators.org. Developers We welcome contributions to BioSimulations, runBioSimulations, and BioSimulations! Please see the Guide to Contributing for information about how to get started including how to install this package and how to run BioSimulations, runBioSimulations, and BioSimulators locally.

This document describes how developers can contribute the BioSimulations and BioSimulators platforms (e.g., web applications, REST APIs, databases, and simulation services). Modelers can contributing models, simulations, and visualizations to BioSimulations via the web application at https://biosimulations.org. Information for simulation software tool developers about contributing containerized simulation tools to BioSimulators is available at https://biosimulators.org/help. Coordinating contributions Before getting started, please contact the lead developers at info@biosimulations.org to coordinate your planned contributions with other ongoing efforts. Please also use GitHub issues to announce your plans to the community so that other developers can provide input into your plans and coordinate their own work. As the development community grows, we will institute additional infrastructure as needed such as a leadership committee and regular online meetings. Repository Conventions The repository uses conventional commits to enable changelog generation and versioning. Commitizen allows developers to easily create compliant commit messages. To use Commitizen, simply run npm run commit insteead of git commit in your workflow. Repository organization The repository is organized as a monorepo using tooling from Nx Apps The apps folder contains code for the high level applications that are a part of Biosimulations. An application is code that is deployed independently, either as a website, API, or backend service. Each app contains a Readme file that is used to describe its purpose and internal organization. Libraries The libraries folder contains code that can be used by multiple apps. To enforce proper separation of concerns and manage dependency trees, Nx provides constraints on the libraries that can be used by each app. For more information, read the Nx documentation , and look at the repository's linting rules . In general, libraries should be organized by the principles recommended here . Coding convention BioSimulations and BioSimulators follow standard TypeScript style conventions: Module names: lower-dash-case Class names: UpperCamelCase Function names: lowerCamelCase Variable names: lowerCamelCase Further information about style conventions can be found in the lint rules definition Linting We strive to create high-quality code. BioSimulations and BioSimulators use ESLint to identify potential errors. ESLint can be executed by running nx affected:lint . Testing We strive to have complete test coverage of BioSimulations and BioSimulators. As such, all contributions to BioSimulations and BioSimulators should be tested. In particular, each module should be accompanied by a specification test in the same directory with the extension .spec.ts . The tests can be executed by running nx affected:test . Upon each push and pull request to GitHub, GitHub will trigger actions to execute all of the tests. Submitting changes Please use GitHub pull requests to submit changes. Each request should include a brief description of the new and/or modified features. Upon each pull request, GitHub will trigger actions to execute all of the tests. Pull requests will be approved once all tests are passing and the pull request is reviewed by one of the lead developers. Releasing and deploying new versions Contact info@biosimulations.org to request release and deployment of new changes. Nx This project uses Nx . The below information should be sufficient for most development in the repository. Quick Start & Documentation Nx Documentation 10-minute video showing all Nx features Interactive Tutorial Generate an application Run ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app to generate an application. You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well. When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace. Generate a library Run ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib to generate a library. You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well. Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from @biosimulations/mylib . Development server Run ng serve my-app for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Code scaffolding Run ng g component my-component --project=my-app to generate a new component. Build Run ng build my-app to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build. Running unit tests Run ng test my-app to execute the unit tests via Jest . Run nx affected:test to execute the unit tests affected by a change. Running end-to-end tests Run ng e2e my-app to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress . Run nx affected:e2e to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change. Understand your workspace Run nx dep-graph to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
